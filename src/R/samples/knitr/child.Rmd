<table border="1" style="background-color:yellow;">
```{r include=FALSE}
out = NULL
for (i in c(1:5)) {
  out = c(out,'<tr>')
  for(j in c(1:3)) {
    out = c(out, paste("<td>",i,".",j,"</td>"))
  }
  out = c(out,"</tr>")
}
```
`r paste(out, collapse='\n')`
  
  <tr><td colspan="3">Inline R: `r i`</td></tr>
</table>
